# Ibrahim Adeniyi

I'm a senior software developer with over 7 years of experience. I work on AI-powered customer service tools and developer tooling. Previously, I freelanced building web applications for various clients.

I specialize in full-stack development with React, TypeScript, and Node.js. I enjoy building scalable applications and exploring new technologies that solve real problems.

This is my personal website built with Next.js, TypeScript, and Tailwind CSS. Inspired by [leerob.com](https://leerob.com/).
