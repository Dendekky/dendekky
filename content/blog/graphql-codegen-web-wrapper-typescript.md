Creating graphql result types for a web application can be done by adding an extra step to your application's development process.
That step has been extensively covered by the guys at [The Guild](https://the-guild.dev/graphql/codegen).

However, I've created a [codegen web wrapper](https://dendekky-graphql-codegen.vercel.app/) that serves a slightly different purpose which includes but might not be limited to:

- Skipping an extra step of adding the codegen to your development process but still wanting to know what result types the graphql api returns.

- Getting all the return types from a graphql endpoint without setting up anything extraneous.

The wrapper guide and source code can be found on [github](https://dendekky-graphql-codegen.vercel.app/).

Let me know what you think.
If you have any questions regarding this, I am available in the comment section. Also, feel free to correct or add anything I might have missed. Do not hesitate to send me a message by email or on [twitter](https://twitter.com/dendekky)
